# IDE Feature Comparison

This repo is a one-stop resource listing out commonly-used IDE features broken down by language and editor.
This can be used to pick an editor for new users, locate gaps in tooling support for authors looking to contribute to a language, or collect links to setup resources for more plugin-drive approaches.
